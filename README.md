# Arduino and DHT22 sensor,Grove gas multichannel sensor, Predictive maintenance Devfest 2022
In this reposiroty we put our code for our arduino temperature and humidity detector for DEVFEST 22 Algiers , in addition to our predictive maintenance model that predicts on the data of the iot sensors<br>
The dataset is available via this link https://www.kaggle.com/code/mpwolke/intel-berkeley-research-lab-txt <br>
The notebook performs an acf content analysis on the data and predicts anomalies
